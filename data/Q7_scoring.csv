"In the model with chocolate before sugarpercent SS for chocolate tells us that by adding the chocolate variable, we are reducing 7368 SS, and only after we explain that amount of variation, the sugarpercent variable will explain some more variation that chocolate has not explained.

When the outcome and explanatory variables are the same all three of the above are supposed to be the same because we simply ran the model twice.
